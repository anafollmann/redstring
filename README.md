# redstring
RedString is a second year school project where we used what we learnt about object orientation and data bases in 2023.

The project was developed with the DAO method taught to us, and front end wasn't obligatory as it's not a subejct we've had yet. The user interaction with the software is through the console. I developed it on my own as the final project for our second semester in Programming Language I and Data Base I. It is entirely in portuguese. 

RedString is a software for creative writting, with the objetive of giving some freedom for writers and joining all and any notes into a single place, allowing users to create broad categories (in the shape of stories, characters and locations) and assign notes to these categories.
